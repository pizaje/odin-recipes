    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>
      An Arepa is a patty made of corndough, then cut in half after cooking and stuffed with a very large variety of ingredients.
      It's a food native to Latin America, being very popular due to its inexpensiveness, low kitchen utility requirements, and high
      ingredient versatility, making it a favorite of many countries such as Colombia and Venezuela.
